Chemical Kinetics

Chemical kinetics is the branch of physical chemistry which deals with a study of the
speed of chemical reactions. Such studies also enable us to understand the mechanism
by which the reaction occurs. Thus, in chemical kinetics we can also determine the rate
of chemical reaction.
From the kinetic stand point the reactions are classified into two groups:
a) homogeneous reactions which occur entirely in one phase b) heterogeneous reactions
where the transformation takes place on the surface of a catalyst or the walls of a container.

1.2

Rate of reaction

The rate of reaction i.e. the velocity of a reaction is the amount of a chemical change
occurring per unit time.
The rate is generally expressed as the decrease in concentration of a reactant or as the
increase in concentration of the product. If Cthe concentration of a reactant at any time
t is, the rate is − dC
dt or if the concentration of a product be xat any time t, the rate would
dx
be dt .
The time is usually expressed in seconds. The rate will have units of concentration
divided by time.
The concentrations are taken in gm-moles/litre, hence rate is moles/litre/second.
Factors influencing the rate of reaction
Rate of a chemical reaction is influenced by the following factors
(i) Temperature (ii) Concentration of the reactants (iii) Nature of reactants (iv) Catalysts
(v) Radiation
(i) Temperature
In most cases, the rate of a reaction in a homogeneous reaction is approximately doubled
or tripled by an increase in temperature of only 100 C. In some cases the rise in reaction
rates are even higher.
(ii) Concentration of the reactants
At a fixed temperature and in the absence of catalyst, the rate of given reaction increases
with increased concentration of reactants. With increasing concentration of the reactant
4

the number of molecules per unit volume is increased, thus the collision frequency is
increased, which ultimately causes increased reaction rate.
(iii) Nature of reactants
A chemical reaction involves the rearrangement of atoms between the reacting molecules
to the product. Old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed. Consequently, the nature and the strength of the bonds in reactant molecules greatly influence the rate of its
transformation into products. The reaction in which involve lesser bond rearrangement
proceeds much faster than those which involve larger bond rearrangement.
(iv) Catalysts
The rate of a chemical reaction is increased in presence of a catalyst which ultimately
enhanced the speed of a chemical reaction.
(v) Radiation
The rate of a number of chemical reactions increases when radiations of specific wave
length are absorbed by the reacting molecules. Such reactions are called photochemical
reactions.
For example, chlorine may be mixed safely with hydrogen in dark, since the reaction
between the two is very slow. However when the mixture is exposed to light, the reaction
is explosive.

1.3

Order of reaction

The order is the number of concentration terms on which reaction rates depends. Thus,
if the rate of a reaction depends on the first power of the concentration of reactant, i.e.
Rate = KC1
Thus the reaction is said to be of the first order. When the rate is proportional to the
product of two reactant concentrations or the square of the concentration of a reactant,
the reaction is of the second order.
For example, the decomposition of hydroiodic acid
Rate = K C2HI
Rate = K C2HI
and the hydrogen - iodine reaction
H2 + I2 −→ 2H I
Rate = KCH2 CI2
Here both are second order reactions.
If the reaction rate is experimentally found to be represented by
−

dC
= KCn
dt

The order of the reaction is n.
If several reactants A, B, C, . . . . . . .etc are involved and it is observed experimentally
that the rate of the process is given by,
−

dc
β γ
= KCAα CB CC .......
dt

Then the order of the reaction would be n = α + β + γ + .......
The reaction is said to be α th order with respect to A, β th order with respect to B etc.
But there are reactions in which the order is fractional i.e. n = 12 , 32 etc.. For example,
3/
d[H ]
the ortho – para hydrogen conversion, its rate is expressed by − dt2 = K CH22

1.4

Molecularity of a reaction

The molecularity of a reaction is defined as the number of molecules or atoms which
take part in the process of a chemical change.
The reaction is said to be unimolecular, bimolecular, termolecular according to one,
two, or three molecules are involved in the process of a chemical change.
The term unimolecular was used for all first order reactions, the term bimolecular for
2nd order reactions etc.

4. Is it possible for a reaction to have identical values for molecularity and order?

1.5

Zero Order Kinetics

A chemical reaction whose rate does not depend on concentration of reactants is called
a zero order chemical reaction.
The rate of the reaction can be written as
dx
dt = Constant
⇒ dx
dt = K
or, dx = K dt
R
R
On integration, dx = K dt
or, x = Kt + Z (Integration Constant).
When t = 0, x = 0 hence Z = 0
So, x = Kt
Or, K = xt
A plot of xversus tshould give a straight line passing through the origin as shown in the
figure and the slope of this straight line isK.
Example: Photochemical combination of H2 and Cl2 to formHCl.

1.6

First Order Kinetics

A reaction of the first order is represented as
X −→ Y
where X is the reactant and Y the product. The rate of the reaction will be directly
proportional to the concentration i.e.,
−

(1.1)

dc
= KC
dt

in which C is the concentration of the reactant at any time t and K is a constant, called
the velocity constant or specific reaction rate.
Thus −
On integration −

− ln c = kt + Z(Integration Constant).
If at the start of the reaction the initial concentration of the reactant is Co then we have
at t = 0 , C = Co
Substituting − ln Co = Z
− lnC = Kt − lnCo

Or

Co

C

= e−Kt Or
C = Co e−Kt

(1.2)

The concentration C therefore diminishes exponentially with time.
We may also write
Co − C = Co (1 − e−Kt )

(1.3)

The rate equation may also be conveniently expressed in an alternative form, by expressing the rate in terms of the product. When x moles per unit volume of product Y
is formed from the reactant, the concentration of the reactant is(a − x), where a is the
initial concentration of the reactants. So
−

(a − x) = K(a − x)

On integration

When the initial concentration ais not known but the concentrations at two intervals
t1 and t2 are known, the rate equation can be derived. If x1 and x2 are the concentrations

log(a − x) = − K 2.303 t + log a
If log(a − x) is plotted graphically against time, it would give a straight line. So when
a plot constructed from experimental values of log(a − x) and tis found to be linear, the
K
reaction is of the first order. The slope of the line is − 2.303
from which the velocity
constant K can be determined.

Second Order Kinetics

A reaction will be of the second order when the reaction rate would depend upon the
product of two concentrations.
Second order reactions are of two types
(i) The rate is proportional to the square of the same reactant concentration
(ii) The rate is proportional to the product of the two reactant concentration
(i) The rate is proportional to the square of the same reactant concentration
Let say, 2A −→ Products

If the two substances have the same initial concentration(a)and if x denotes the concentration of the reactants which disappears in time t, then the rate will be

Pseudo unimolecular Reactions

There are a number of reactions, which follow the first order kinetics though more than
one kind of reactants is involved in the reaction. Common examples are the inversion of
cane sugar or the hydrolysis of an ester in an acid medium.
C12 H22 011 + H2 0 = 2 C6 H12 06

CH3 COO C2 H5 + H2 0 = CH3 COO H + C2 H5 OH
These are truly second order reactions. Two substances water and cane sugar, or water
and ester participate, but the rate of reaction is experimentally observed to depend only
on the concentration of cane sugar or ester.
A second order reaction is governed by the equation (3) . If the concentration of one of
the participants is very large compared to that of the other, say b >> a, then b−x ≈ band
a − b ≈ −b,which is practically constant.
Hence, equation (3) reduces to
Kb =

(a − x)

Or K = 1t ln (a −a x)
That is, under these circumstances, the reaction will follow first order kinetics.
In these reactions water is present in such large excess, that even if the reaction is complete, the concentration of water would virtually remain unaltered.

Catalytic Reactions

Definition
Catalysis is the process of enhancing the rate of the reaction by means of a foreign
substance which remains unchanged in mass and chemical composition.

Classification
i) Homogeneous Catalysis
Homogeneous Catalysis is where the catalyst and the reactant constitute a single phase.
ii) Heterogeneous Catalysis
Heterogeneous Catalysis is where the catalyst and the reactant constitute separate phase.
Homogeneous Catalysis
Example
i) Nitric Oxide in the oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide.
ii) H + ion acts as a catalyst in the hydrolysis of ester or sugar.
16

Mechanism
Theory (Intermediate compound formation theory)
Substrate (S) reacts with the catalyst (C) producing an intermediate compound(X). The
intermediate compound then reacts to produce the product (P) along with the catalyst
(C). Moreover the intermediate compound also decomposes to produce the substrate
along with the catalyst.

ii) The constant KC is known as the “catalytic co-efficient” for the catalyst.
Characteristics
i) The catalyst remains unchanged in mass and in chemical composition at the end of
the reaction.
ii) A very minute quantity of a catalyst can produce an appreciable effect on the speed
of a reaction.
iii) A catalyst can not start a reaction but only increases its speed. The catalyst really
provides an alternative path for the transformation in which the require activation energy
is less. Lesser activation energy permits larger amounts of reaction in a given time.
iv) The catalyst does not affect the final state of equilibrium.

Temperature and Reaction Rates

The Arrhenius Equation
Temperature has a profound influence on the reaction velocity. In homogenous thermal
reactions, for every ten degree rise in temperature, the velocity of reaction is doubled or
trebled. The ratio is called temperature coefficient.
Kt+10
≈ 2 or 3
Kt

18

Arrhenius (1889) showed that the velocity constant (K) of a chemical process increases
exponentially with temperature for a large number of reactions. It was observed that the
plot of log K against gives a linear relation.
He, therefore, suggested empirically the relation as
d ln K
E
=
dT
RT 2
or K = Ae−E /RT (A = constant)
A is called the frequency factor or pre exponential factor.
E is called the activation energy of the reaction.
These two quantities have definite values for any given reaction. By measuring the
velocity constant K and K / at two temperatures T and T / respectively, we have,
log K = −

Hence the activation energy E is easily obtained.
Alternatively, a plot of log K against T1 gives a straight line. The slope of such line gives

the value of 2.303R
from which E is evaluated. The intercept of the line would also enable
one to find out the value of the frequency factor A.

Activation energy of a reaction: its significance
The average energy of the reactant is represented by EA and that of the resultant byEB .
But if EA is greater than EB the reactant A will not be straight way transformed to the
product B. There is a minimum energy level for the reaction denoted by Ex to which the
reactant molecule must be raised in order to enable it to undergo the chemical change.
The excess or additional energy (EX − EA )which the reactant must acquire in order to
20

Figure 1.5: Potential energy profile of exothermic and endothermic reaction
undergo transformation is the activation energy E1.
Molecules, having energy EX or above are said to be in activated state and such molecules
only are fit for chemical reaction.
IfE2 > E1 , the reaction is evidently exothermic, where as ifE2 < E1 , the reaction is
endothermic.

1.11

Collision Theory

The collision theory explains the mechanism of bimolecular reactions, but with unimolecular reactions the theory apparently fails. In the unimolecular reactions which are
also of the first order, only one molecule takes part in the reaction.
According to Lindemann hypothesis the molecules acquire activation energy through
collisions, but the activated molecules decompose only after some time has elapsed after the collision. That is, there is a time lag between the moment of activation and the
moment of decomposition. When this time lag is relatively large, there is every possibility for most of the activated molecules being deactivated by subsequent collisions to
ordinary molecules. As a result, the rate of decomposition will not be proportional to
all the activated molecules but only to a fraction which survives the time lag. The ac21

deactivation and through decomposition.

Now, activated molecules are short lived and have a small concentration at any time during the process. So from the steady state principle, the rate of formation of A∗ molecules

Thus at low concentration the process would follow second order kinetics.

1.12

Transition state theory

According to this theory, the two reactants say, AB and C first form a transition complex
A——–B——–C which then decomposes into A and BC.

Figure 1.6: Potential energy profile of an exothermic reaction

The basic idea is that, we must some how force C to come so close to B that B becomes
undecided as to which atoms it now belongs to. This state of indecision as to B, being
simultaneously attached both to A and C, though some how loosely than before, is the
transition state, also called the activated complex. The energy necessary to push C to
approach B to form this transition state or activated complex is the energy of activation.
The observed rate of reaction would be equal to the net rate of formation of the activated
complex.

Review Questions
1. What is rate of a reaction? What is its unit?

Answer:

The rate of reaction i.e. the velocity of a reaction is the amount of a chemical
change occurring per unit time.
The rate is generally expressed as the decrease in concentration of a reactant or as
the increase in concentration of the product. If C is the concentration of a reactant
at any time t, the rate is − dC
dt or if the concentration of a product be xat any time t,
dx
the rate would be dt .
The unit of reaction rate is moles/litre/second.
2. What is rate constant? What is the unit of rate constant for nth order reaction?

24

Answer:

Let us consider a reaction,
X −→ Y
where X is the reactant and Y the product. The rate of the reaction will be directly
proportional to the concentration i.e.,
(1.14)

dc

dt

in which C is the concentration of the reactant at any time t and K is a constant,
called the velocity constant or specific reaction rate.
In general, the units of K for a reaction of n th order would be given by,

3. What is order of a reaction? Give an example of fractional order reaction.

mechanism.

6. What is pseudo unimolecular reaction? Show that the specific reaction rate
of a pseudo unimolecular reaction follows first order kinetics.

27

Chemistry-I

Answer:

There are a number of reactions, which follow the first order kinetics though more
than one kind of reactants are involved in the reaction. These types of reactions
are called pseudo unimolecular reaction.
The example of pseudo unimolecular reaction is the inversion of cane sugar.
C12 H22 011 + H2 0 = 2 C6 H12 06
A second order reaction, in which two reactants are different, is governed by the
equation:
K=

1
b(a − x)
ln
t(a − b) a(b − x)

If the concentration of one of the participants is very large compared to that of the
other, say b >> a, then b − x ≈ band a − b ≈ −b,which is practically constant.
Hence, the equation reduces to
Kb =

1
a
ln
t
(a − x)

Or K / = 1t ln (a −a x)
That is, under these circumstances, the reaction will follow first order kinetics.

7. A reaction is found to be zero order. Will its molecularity be zero?

Answer:

No, Molecularity of a reaction can not be zero.

28

8. Write down the Arrhenius equation. Explain the each term.

Answer:
Arrhenius (1889) showed that the velocity constant (K) of a chemical process
increases exponentially with temperature for a large number of reactions. It was
observed that the plot of log K against gives a linear relation.
He, therefore, suggested empirically the relation as
d ln K
E
=
dT
RT 2
or K = Ae−E /RT (A = constant)
Where, K = the velocity constant or specific reaction rate.
E = the activation energy of the reaction.
A = the frequency factor or pre exponential factor.
T = the absolute temperature.
R = the universal gas constant.
Arrhenius equation may also be represented in logarithmic form as,
log K = −

E

× + log A
2.303R T

9. Is a first order or a second order reaction completed?

29

Chemistry-I

Answer:
In a first order reactionC = Co e−Kt , the reaction can not be complete because C
would become zero at infinite time.
The rate equation of a second order reaction is K =

x
at(a−x)

when x = a, t = ∞.

So a second order reaction also is not completed.

10. What is the special characteristic of a zero order reaction?

Answer:
The rate equation of a zero order reaction isK = C0 −C
t , where C0 is the initial
concentration and Cis the concentration at any timet.
When, C = 0; t = CK0 , which is a finite quantity.
So, the zero order reaction will be completed and rate of the reaction is independent of the concentrations of the reactants.

1. At 25◦ C the half-life period for the decomposition of N2 O5 is 5.7 hr. and is
independent of the initial pressure of N2 O5 . Calculate (a) the specific rate
constant (b) the time required to go to 90% completion.

30

Answer:

As half-life period is independent of initial i.e., concentration, so it is a first order
reaction, whose half-life period

31

Chemistry-I

Answer:

Let us first see whether it is first order or not. For first order reaction
K =

1
a
ln
t a−x

Since it is the reactant (H2O2) that reacts with KMnO4 , so volume of KMnO4
required at any time is proportional to concentration of H2 O2 present.
So initial volume Vo ∝ a
and volume required at time ‘t’ Vt ∝ (a − x)
So, K =

1
t

ln VVot ; Here Vo = 46.2 ml.

Putting t = 5
mins.

Vt = 37.1 ml

K = 0.043 min−1

Putting t = 10
mins.

Vt = 29.1 ml

K = 0.046 min−1

Putting t = 20
mins.

Vt = 19.6 ml

K = 0.043 min−1

Since constant values are coming, given data fit well in the first order rate equation. Hence, the reaction is of first order with average rate constant = 0.044 min−1
Hence t1/2 =

0.693
0.044

= 15.75 min .

4. At 378.5◦ C. the half-life period for the first order thermal decomposition of
ethylene oxide is 363 min and the energy of activation of the reaction is
52,000 cal/mole. From these data estimate the time required for ethylene
oxide to be 75% decomposed at 450◦ C.

33

Answer:
If K1 is rate constant at 378.5◦ C then as the reaction is first order, so
363 =

or, K1 = 1.91 10−3 min−1
From Arrhenius equation if K2 is rate constant at 450◦ C then

So, 13.7 mins. will be required for 75% decomposition at 450◦ C.

8. The rate of decomposition of a gas was 7.25 in some unit when 5% had reacted and it was 5.14 in the same unit when 20% had undergone decomposition. Calculate the order.

36

Answer:

Rate r = K.Cn [n = order]
If C0 is initial concentration, then during 5% reaction C = 0.95 C0 and during
20% reaction C = 0.80 C0 .
Hence 7.25 = K (0.95 C0 )n
and 5.14 = K (0.80 C0 )n

0.95 n
or, 7.25
5.14 = 0.80
or, 1.4105 = (1.18)n
or, n =

log 1.4105
log 1.18

= 2

Hence it is second order reaction.
